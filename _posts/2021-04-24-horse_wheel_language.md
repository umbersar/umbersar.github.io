[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691148182/the-horse-the-wheel-and-language) is a book by David Anthony. I do not remember how I came across this book but glad that I purchased it to read. Perhaps my interest in it was piqued by its promise of unveiling the history of Indo-European language speakers and tracing the source of migration of the peoples who spoke this language. And what were these people called? Aryans! Ahem.

## How did the Indo-Eurpoean language tree came to light?

[William Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jones_(philologist)), an English jurist and philologist, was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court at Calcutta, the then British India's highest court. To tackle the local judicial matters, he found that the knowledge of Sanskrit language was necessary as the locals would quote local laws in that language. And so he began studying Sanskrit. Upon completion of his Sanskrit studies, he made a very famous observation which some regard as what gave birth to the field of language classification. He quipped:

So what is the language tree which places at it's source the Proto-Indo-European language from which Willian Jones suggested that Sanskrit, Latin and Greek were derived. The book gives us a language tree which classifies not only these 3 but a whole lot of other languages in the same family, such as Punjabi which is my native language. Here it is:
